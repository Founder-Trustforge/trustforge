On-chain reputation for ethical crypto
# TrustForge  
> **Forge Trust. Earn Integrity. Own Your Reputation.**

TrustForge is a decentralized reputation protocol that turns ethical on-chain behavior into a user-owned, monetizable asset: the **TrustScore NFT**.

We enable builders to prove integrity *before* token launch—and users to verify if a new project is more than a pump-and-dump scheme.
