# EthosiFi  
On-chain reputation for ethical crypto

# EthosiFi    
> **Forge Trust. Earn Integrity. Own Your Reputation.**

EthosiFi is a decentralized reputation protocol that turns ethical on-chain behavior into a user-owned, monetizable asset: the **TrustScore NFT**.

We enable builders to prove integrity *before* token launch—and users to verify if a new project is more than a pump-and-dump scheme.

## Why EthosiFi?

- 🔒 **Pre-token reputation**: Teams earn trust *before* liquidity exists  
- 🛡️ **Scam-resistant**: On-chain proof > marketing hype  
- 🌐 **Private by default**: Zero-knowledge proofs protect your history  
- ⚖️ **Legally aligned**: Built-in channels for lawful anti-fraud reporting  
- 🏦 **Business-grade infrastructure**: Treasury managed via multi-chain Gnosis Safe (Ethereum, Base, Polygon)  
- 🧩 **Web4-native**: Reputation as a composable, cross-protocol primitive—not just a profile badge  

## How It Works

### Verified Builder Recognition
- Exemplar contributors receive **two NFTs**:
  - A **non-transferable TrustScore NFT** (Soulbound) proving verified contribution
  - A **limited transferable Legacy NFT** as a collectible reward
- **NFTs are never issued to customers**—only to vetted builders and partners

### Scam Intelligence Layer
- Community-submitted data on suspicious sites/contracts is aggregated **anonymously**
- Designed to feed **lawful enforcement pathways**, not vigilante action
- Supports global collaboration while respecting jurisdictional boundaries

### Ethical & Legal Posture
- We **avoid naming conflicts** and operate under clear legal frameworks
- No engagement in risky or unlawful behavior—ever
- All systems designed for **regulatory resilience**, not evasion
