# VeriChain Genesis TrustScore Standard v0.1  
*Published: January 13, 2026 | ENS: verichain.eth*

This standard defines how crypto projects can earn a **Genesis TrustScore**—a verifiable, on-chain reputation metric based on **behavioral integrity**, not document claims.

> ⚠️ **Note**: VeriChain verifies **on-chain actions** (e.g., LP locks, governance participation). We do **not** verify off-chain documents like KYC, diplomas, or PDFs.

## Purpose
To distinguish legitimate builders from scam artists by rewarding transparency, consistency, and user-centric behavior in DeFi and token launches.

## Scoring Categories (Max: 500 pts)
